## Description
In this project, the starter code did not use an Apollo server to serve data. I was given a fully functioning application and tasked with implementing Apollo and GraphQL.

This is a simple book search engine that uses Google Books to deliver information.

## Usage

Search for books by author, title, or series by using the search bar at the top of the page.
